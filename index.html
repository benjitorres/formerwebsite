        <p>I'm going to write one continuous thing on here. For several reasons but here are two of them. I saw <a href="https://yacine.ca" target="_blank">yacine.ca</a> do the same thing and because I'm bored. I think what that guy does is write out from google docs and paste on his site and then, if long enough, he makes it into a blog post. That sounds like a fun idea but I don't want to have to make blog posts. I just want to write dates and people can find things that way if they care enough. I don't think making this site will be helpful or useful but I just feel like doing this. I also know that it probably won't look good on phones and that kinda matters a lot. I also know that links look kinda weird but I just wanna leave this here and unfixed.</p>

        <p>Plan for summer: discrete math, theory of mind, and calculus II @ a CC. 
          Why Calc II? Because it's a pre-req for 56 which is linear algebra (in the context of stats and data science). Wasn't taught before but it's being taught by Alexander Paulin who has a reputation of being a good math professor. I really want to take linear algebra because it looks cool but other professors seem to get bad review. I'm glad it's being taught by someone who seems to be a good professor. I have faith that I can complete those two classes at the same time. Thank God. Cute chubby kitty cat as Guts. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Am feeling slightly sad at the idea that I'm not building anything over the summer and have no plans to do anything besides math classes. I wish God gave me more ideas. Seems like the more I chase ideas the less I can see.

          If Bart is so expensive because it's a government thing, wouldn't it be easier to make a private thing, cheaper, and then sell to the government for a fraction of what it would cost to build if it wasn't something private? I'm surprised more people don't try to take this on since it's an obvious problem that needs to be fixed. Or something better might be to create the tools to have the government build things on their own but as we know, the government is pretty slow at building things so maybe this doesn't need to exist. Anyways, a private thing might just be better as long as it's cheaper, faster, safer, and better than Bart. I see no reason why this wouldn't exist. I know you need to dig into stuff and maybe take things down but I think it would improve the lives of many who live here. Or maybe we can build something that replaces or expands on Bart. Why hasn't anyone done this yet?</p>

          <p>I want to be able to teach people the art in math because it's something cool and never gets taught. I have a feeling that most people who love math have some intuition about what makes it beautiful but they may not be able to articulate the beauty behind it. I think part of the beauty comes from the fact that it answers a lot of “why” questions that aren't normally answered. Even in higher level maths it seems like we don't learn the why and it's something people are really curious about. I think there's a way to do this without having to get into logic and a whole other branch of math. 
          I love calculus but I really only understand the computation part. If you asked me for definitions of things like limits or derivatives I'm not sure I'd be able to answer adequately. Maybe showing people the beauty of math will make them happier.
