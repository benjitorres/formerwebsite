        <p>I'm going to write one continuous thing on here. For several reasons but here are two of them. I saw <a href="https://yacine.ca" target="_blank">yacine.ca</a> do the same thing and because I'm bored. I think what that guy does is write out from google docs and paste on his site and then, if long enough, he makes it into a blog post. That sounds like a fun idea but I don't want to have to make blog posts. I just want to write dates and people can find things that way if they care enough. I don't think making this site will be helpful or useful but I just feel like doing this. I also know that it probably won't look good on phones and that kinda matters a lot. I also know that links look kinda weird but I just wanna leave this here and unfixed.</p>
