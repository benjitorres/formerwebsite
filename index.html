        <p>I'm going to write one continuous thing on here. For several reasons but here are two of them. I saw <a href="https://yacine.ca" target="_blank">yacine.ca</a> do the same thing and because I'm bored. I think what that guy does is write out from google docs and paste on his site and then, if long enough, he makes it into a blog post. That sounds like a fun idea but I don't want to have to make blog posts. I just want to write dates and people can find things that way if they care enough. I don't think making this site will be helpful or useful but I just feel like doing this. I also know that it probably won't look good on phones and that kinda matters a lot. I also know that links look kinda weird but I just wanna leave this here and unfixed.</p>

        <p>Plan for summer: discrete math, theory of mind, and calculus II @ a CC. 
          Why Calc II? Because it's a pre-req for 56 which is linear algebra (in the context of stats and data science). Wasn't taught before but it's being taught by Alexander Paulin who has a reputation of being a good math professor. I really want to take linear algebra because it looks cool but other professors seem to get bad review. I'm glad it's being taught by someone who seems to be a good professor. I have faith that I can complete those two classes at the same time. Thank God. Cute chubby kitty cat as Guts.

          <p>Am feeling slightly sad at the idea that I'm not building anything over the summer and have no plans to do anything besides math classes. I wish God gave me more ideas. Seems like the more I chase ideas the less I can see.
