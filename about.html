            <article>I'm Benjamin Torres. I study math and philosophy. I care more about math than I do philosophy and computer science. For some reason, I just don't like coding. I don't see the point. It seems cool that some people can do it but I don't really care about it. Solving a CS problem doesn't feel worth it like it does for math problems. I wish I cared more about CS because it seems like I live in the perfect place to pursue that. </article>
